    The purpose of this app is to tell DGA-generated and non-DGA-generated domains apart using a combination of 
    linguistic features that characterize the domain name. By transforming raw domain strings to Machine Learning features, 
    it can be determined whether a given domain is legit or not.

    **ðŸ‘ˆ Go to the DGA app** to see how it works!
    ### Want to learn more about DGA:question:
